This is a NeuroAI project to build a model that can predict the response of simulated V1 neurons to a set of naturalistic color images. This is done by implementing a CNN model with a sparse readout layer that can factorize between neurons that code for spatial and feature dimensions. Additionally, the model's internal representations are investigated and its performance is compared to a simple linear model and a classic CNN model.
